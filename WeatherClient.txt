
Internship Task - 2: Java Weather API Client

Submitted by: Puranjay Saraswat
Technology Used: Java
API Used: OpenWeatherMap (https://api.openweathermap.org)

Description:
This Java program fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays:
- Temperature (in Celsius)
- Humidity (in %)
- Weather description (e.g., scattered clouds, clear sky)

Key Features:
- Uses HttpURLConnection to make a GET request to the REST API
- Manually parses JSON data using string operations (no external JARs)
- Simple and beginner-friendly code with human-style comments
- Displays full API response for debugging and learning

Input:
- City name is specified in the code (e.g., "Gwalior")
- API key is required (a free one from OpenWeatherMap)

Output:
- Prints the full API response (JSON)
- Extracted temperature, humidity, and weather description

Sample Output:
üåê Full API Response:
{"coord":{"lon":77.2167,"lat":28.6667},...}
üå¶Ô∏è Weather Report for Gwalior:
Temperature: 31.2¬∞C
Humidity: 49%
Description: scattered clouds

Improvements to Try:
- Take city name as user input using Scanner
- Add a GUI using Swing
- Add error handling for invalid city names

Note:
This version does NOT require any external JAR (like org.json or GSON).
All logic is based on core Java libraries only.
